- **Components**:
  - **Customer Service**: Handles customer data and interactions.
  - **Reward Service**: Manages reward calculations and updates.
  - **Transaction Repository**: Stores and retrieves transaction records.
  - **API Gateway**: Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate service.

## Data Flow

- **Transaction Recording**: Data flows from the customer transaction input to the transaction repository and reward service.
- **Reward Calculation**: Rewards are computed based on transaction data and updated in the customerâ€™s profile.

## Use Cases
1. **Customer Registration**
   - **Description**: Customers register for the reward program.
   - **Actors**: Customer
   - **Preconditions**: Customer provides valid registration details.
   - **Postconditions**: Customer is added to the system with a new profile.

2. **Transaction Recording**
   - **Description**: Records a transaction and updates rewards.
   - **Actors**: System, Customer
   - **Preconditions**: Transaction details are valid.
   - **Postconditions**: Transaction is saved, and rewards are updated.

## Assumptions
